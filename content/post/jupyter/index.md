title: Research Group in Political Economy and Game Theory - PEGAT
---


The group's research topics include political alliances, party discipline, self-selection of politicians and their selection by parties, populism, historical advantage, among others. Although the group was born in association with a Department of Economics, it is multidisciplinary, so it is open to contributions from Political Science, Mathematics and other related fields.
