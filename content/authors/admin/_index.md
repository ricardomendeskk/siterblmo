Doctorate Course in Applied Economics from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, researching Game Theory with questions involving auctions, bargains, sequential games, global games and peer effects.

Graduated in Mathematics at the Federal University of Viçosa and obtained the title of Master in Applied Economics at the Federal University of Juiz de Fora.
